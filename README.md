# NetflixOriginals2016-2020
I made an exploratory analisis of the original content created by Netflix, between 2016 and 2020, in this case cleaning the date with MS Excel. 
Using Power BI, a created an interactive dashboard, where the following information can be seen:
-Total numbers of languages used
-Total genres
-Average IMDB score
-Top10 languages, Top10 Genres and a graph line with total titles and genres per year.

The dataset was pulled from: https://www.kaggle.com/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores
